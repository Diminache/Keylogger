# Keylogger
This Python Program logs the users keystrokes by utilizing the pynput library and sends an email containing the captured keystrokes.

For the email account you can edit the code to your own email adrress and the email address you want to send it to. 
For the password, you would need to go to this link: 
https://myaccount.google.com/u/2/?hl=en&utm_source=OGB&utm_medium=act. After doing so go to 'Security', then go to '2-Step Verification'. 
After you do so then you should then scroll down to 'App Passwords'. Click on 'Select app' -> 'Other(custom name)' -> and name it whatever you would like. 
Then click the 'generate' button and then copy paste the lengthy password google generates for you.
